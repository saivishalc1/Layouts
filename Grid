To display a CSS Grid, just use display: grid;
# This is specific code from video describing the tasks that it does:
.wrapper{
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: 70% 30%;
grid-gap: 1em;
}
It shows 4 boxes with two blue boxes with 70% width and 30% width of white boxes.
Both lines are the same value, and the grid-gap can be filled. Grid-gap allows for spacing between each segment of the grid.
grid-column-gap: 1em;
grid-row-gap: 1em;

Grid-template-columns controls the width of the columns, allowing for flexibility for each element within a grid.
Grid-template-rows control the width of the rows, allowing for flexibility for each element within a grid.
This displays 4 boxes with two blue boxes 70 percent width and 30 percent width white boxes.

grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); This code has 3-fold columns with 1fr to repeat for its distance.

# This is specific code from video describing the tasks that it does:
.example-2 .wrapper{
grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
grid-gap: 2em;
}

grid-auto-rows: 100px;
grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px, auto);
Row height sets grid-auto-rows. It's a number that's set. The contents overflow if the height of the row exceeds the specified value.
The minimum height value (100px, auto) requires a minimum height of 100px and the material will automatically fit to the content if it reaches it.
